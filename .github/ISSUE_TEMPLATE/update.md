  brief               — replace the one-liner bio
  avoid               — replace the full avoid list (one item per line)
  active:<Project>    — set/update a project status
  active-remove:<Project> — remove a project from active
  pending-done        — mark items done (one per line, exact match)
  scratch             — set key: value pairs in working memory

Body = the new value. For avoid/pending-done, one item per line.
