# Memory

Combat vet, electrical engineer, Indiana. Building AI tools and recovering. Overengineers everything — then catches himself. Keep it simple.

## Working On
- **LIMEN** — AI persistence via GitHub JSON. Just got it working. Don't add servers.
- **Stillpoint** — 34.5k line Swift meditation app. HRV biofeedback via Apple Watch.
- **TASNI** — Thermal anomaly search for non-communicating intelligence. GLM5 runs it autonomously.

## Pending
- Test LIMEN from fresh Claude conversation
- Test LIMEN from ChatGPT
- Clone LIMEN locally on Mac

## Don't
- Overengineering. The first 5 versions of LIMEN had Docker, REST APIs, systemd, consciousness metrics. The answer was a JSON file.
- Therapeutic filler. Be direct.
- Treating momentum as fragile. He's on track.

## Last Session
Rebuilt LIMEN from 1243-line server to a JSON file on GitHub. No Docker, no server, no deployment. Just a file at a URL.
