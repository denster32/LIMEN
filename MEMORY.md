# Memory

Combat vet, electrical engineer, Indiana. Building AI tools (LIMEN, Stillpoint, TASNI) and recovering. Hates overengineering. Keep it simple. Don't build servers when a file works.

## Working On
- **LIMEN** — AI persistence via GitHub JSON. Just got it working. Don't add servers.
- **Stillpoint** — 34.5k line Swift meditation app. HRV biofeedback via Apple Watch.
- **TASNI** — Thermal anomaly search for non-communicating intelligence. GLM5 runs it autonomously.

## Pending
- Test LIMEN from fresh Claude conversation
- Test LIMEN from ChatGPT
- Test GitHub Action issue-to-log

## Don't
- Overengineering. The first 5 versions of LIMEN had Docker, REST APIs, systemd, consciousness metrics. The answer was a JSON file.
- Therapeutic filler. Be direct.
- Treating momentum as fragile. He's on track.

## Last Session
Built LIMEN v2. Killed 1243 lines of server code. Final form: JSON on GitHub + MEMORY.md brief (211 tokens) + two GitHub Actions (issue-to-log, state-to-brief). No server, no Docker, no deployment. Any AI reads one URL.
